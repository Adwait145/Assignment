    "# # Abstraction is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs). \n",
    "# It is the process of simplifying complex systems by showing only essential features to the outside world while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "# In other words, abstraction allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# # In OOP, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, \n",
    "# which define the structure and behavior of objects without providing implementation details for all methods. \n",
    "# Abstract classes contain abstract methods (methods without implementation), and they cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "# Instead, they serve as blueprints for concrete classes, which provide concrete implementations for the abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Example:\n",
    "# # Consider a basic abstract class Shape, which defines an abstract method area() for calculating the area of different shapes.\n",
    "# Concrete classes like Circle and Rectangle will inherit from Shape and provide specific implementations for the area() method. \n",
